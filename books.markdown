I'm trying to downsize my dead tree book library. If you're interested in any of the following books, [tweet me](http://twitter.com/jennjenn), [email me](mailto:jenn+books@jennvargas.com), or send me a text if we're actually friends. I'd prefer not to have to ship any, so first dibs go to people who can pick them up from me in Manhattan or Brooklyn.
