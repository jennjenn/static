I'm trying to downsize my dead tree book library. If you're interested in any of the following books, [tweet me](http://twitter.com/jennjenn), [email me](mailto:jenn+books@jennvargas.com), or send me a text if we're actually friends. I'd prefer not to have to ship any, so first dibs go to people who can pick them up from me in Manhattan or Brooklyn.

A lot of these were school books, hence the theme. All of the spines are in perfect condition because I'm OCD like that. You can have them for free, but if that would make you feel guilty, I wouldn't say no to an amazon giftcard to offset my Kindle addiction.
