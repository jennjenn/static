# Help me get rid of my stuff?

## Books
A lot of these were school books, hence the theme. All of the spines are in perfect condition because I'm OCD like that. You can have them for free, but if that would make you feel guilty, I wouldn't say no to an amazon giftcard to offset my Kindle addiction.
