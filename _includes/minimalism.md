# Help me get rid of my stuff?

### I'm selling it all, packing up what's left, and buying a plane ticket to who knows where. 

Here's a list of my stuff. If you're interested in any of it, [email me](mailto:jenn@jennvargas.com), [tweet me](http://twitter.com/jennjenn), or use some other clever method of communication.

## Books
A lot of these were school books, hence the theme. All of the spines are in perfect condition because I'm OCD like that. You can have them for free, but if that would make you feel guilty, I wouldn't say no to an amazon giftcard to offset my Kindle addiction.
